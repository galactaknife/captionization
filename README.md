# captionization

Run by using `python run.py`

Uses a web interface to execute a ffmpeg command, making it easier for captions to be added without knowing bash.

Needed in order for successful conversion: 

<ol>
  <li>A video file</li>
  <li>An SRT file</li>
</ol>

Outputs: 

<ol>
  <li>A captionized mp4 file</li>
</ol>
